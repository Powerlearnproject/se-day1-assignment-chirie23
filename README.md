# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is a branch of computer science that is involved in developing, testing and maintaining software.
Reliability-it ensures the software performs as expected
Efficiency-helps optimize the developers workflow while maintaining high standards
Scalability and flexibiity-nsures the system can handle increased load without affecting perfomance
Security-Implement protectionpractce like authentication,authoritization and encryption to secure users info

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning
Requirement analysis
Design
Coding
Analysis

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology, it is linear and sequential each phase is completed before moving on. It is ideal when a project has well defined requirements.
Agile methodoly , it is iterative and incremental, testing is continuous and it is done after each iterative. It is ideal if athe project has dynamic requirements and needs the clients feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- develop programs and systems using programing language and software, and maintaining and updating the software to keep it functional.
Quality assurance engineer-collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
Project manager-Assembles and leads the team, create blueprint for the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- It is a platform that facilitates creation of other software applications by creating the space to write,compile and debug code, for example VSCode.
VCS- It is a software tool that help software teams managechanges to source code over time, for example Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time constraints,it is a demanding and time intensive field requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet the deadlines.
Changing software requirements, software requirements anr dynamic and subject to frequent change making it challenging for engineers to develop solution while anticipating future updated and bug fixes.
Rapid technological advancements- places pressure on software engineers to stay current


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests- Tests individul menthods and functions.
Integration tests- verify that modules or services used in your application work together
System tests- Focuses on the software system as a whole the functionality
Acceptance tests- tets if a system meets business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired solutions
Improved user experience
Increased flexxibility
Developer control

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write a report
Write a report on the challenges being faced by communities living in the rural areas of Kenya.
Clarity- Improved promt specifies what is needed a reprt of challenges faced by communities
Specific details- Describing what is needed the challenges that the people face in the rural area of Kenya
Concise- The additional details provide a clear picture without being complicated, making it easier to understand what is needed
